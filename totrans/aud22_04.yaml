- en: '*Stable:* These features will be maintained long-term and there should generally
    be no major performance limitations or gaps in documentation. We also expect to
    maintain backwards compatibility (although breaking changes can happen and notice
    will be given one release ahead of time).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Beta:* Features are tagged as Beta because the API may change based on user
    feedback, because the performance needs to improve, or because coverage across
    operators is not yet complete. For Beta features, we are committing to seeing
    the feature through to the Stable classification. We are not, however, committing
    to backwards compatibility.'

- en: '*Prototype:* These features are typically not available as part of binary distributions
    like PyPI or Conda, except sometimes behind run-time flags, and are at an early
    stage for feedback and testing.'
