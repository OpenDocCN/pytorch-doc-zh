- en: On top of the many models, datasets, and image transforms, Torchvision also
    provides training reference scripts. These are the scripts that we use to train
    the [models](models.html#models) which are then available with pre-trained weights.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These scripts are not part of the core package and are instead available [on
    GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references). We currently
    provide references for [classification](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/classification),
    [detection](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/detection),
    [segmentation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/segmentation),
    [similarity learning](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/similarity),
    and [video classification](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/video_classification).

    or the latest torchvision version. This means that to use them, **you might need

- en: If you need to rely on an older stable version of pytorch or torchvision, e.g.
    torchvision 0.10, then it’s safer to use the scripts from that corresponding release
    on GitHub, namely [https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/v0.10.0/references](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/v0.10.0/references).
