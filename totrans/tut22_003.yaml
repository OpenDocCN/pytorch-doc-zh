- en: Prototype features are not available as part of binary distributions like PyPI
    or Conda (except maybe behind run-time flags). To test these features we would,
    depending on the feature, recommend building from master or using the nightly
    wheels that are made available on [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org).

    only on these features. Based on this feedback and potential further engagement
    between community members, we as a community will decide if we want to upgrade
    the level of commitment or to fail fast.'
