本教程展示了如何使用 Emformer RNN-T 和流式 API 执行在线语音识别。

注意

本教程需要使用 FFmpeg 库和 SentencePiece。

有关详细信息，请参阅可选依赖项。

## 1\. 概述

在线语音识别的执行由以下步骤组成

1.  构建推理管道 Emformer RNN-T 由三个组件组成：特征提取器、解码器和标记处理器。

1.  将波形格式化为预期大小的块。

1.  通过管道传递数据。

## 2\. 准备

```py
import torch
import torchaudio

print(torch.__version__)
print([torchaudio.__version__](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "builtins.str"))

import IPython
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torchaudio.io import StreamReader 
```

```py
2.2.0
2.2.0 
```

## 3\. 构建管道

预训练模型权重和相关管道组件被捆绑为`torchaudio.pipelines.RNNTBundle`。

我们使用`torchaudio.pipelines.EMFORMER_RNNT_BASE_LIBRISPEECH`，这是在 LibriSpeech 数据集上训练的 Emformer RNN-T 模型。

```py
bundle = torchaudio.pipelines.EMFORMER_RNNT_BASE_LIBRISPEECH

feature_extractor = bundle.get_streaming_feature_extractor()
decoder = bundle.get_decoder()
token_processor = bundle.get_token_processor() 
```

```

流式推理适用于具有重叠的输入数据。Emformer RNN-T 模型将输入数据的最新部分视为“右上下文” —— 未来上下文的预览。在每次推理调用中，模型期望主段从上一次推理调用的右上下文开始。以下图示说明了这一点。

![`download.pytorch.org/torchaudio/tutorial-assets/emformer_rnnt_context.png`](img/0e1c9a1ab0a1725ac44a8f5ae79784d9.png)

主段和右上下文的大小，以及预期的采样率可以从 bundle 中检索。

```py
[sample_rate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") = bundle.[sample_rate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")
[segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") = bundle.[segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") * bundle.hop_length
[context_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") = bundle.right_context_length * bundle.hop_length

print(f"Sample rate: {[sample_rate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")}")
print(f"Main segment: {[segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")} frames ({[segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")  /  [sample_rate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")} seconds)")
print(f"Right context: {[context_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")} frames ({[context_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")  /  [sample_rate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")} seconds)") 
```

```py
Sample rate: 16000
Main segment: 2560 frames (0.16 seconds)
Right context: 640 frames (0.04 seconds) 
```

## 4\. 配置音频流

接下来，我们使用`torchaudio.io.StreamReader`配置输入音频流。

有关此 API 的详细信息，请参阅 StreamReader 基本用法。

以下音频文件最初由 LibriVox 项目发布，属于公共领域。

[`librivox.org/great-pirate-stories-by-joseph-lewis-french/`](https://librivox.org/great-pirate-stories-by-joseph-lewis-french/)

出于教程目的，它被重新上传。

```py
[src](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "builtins.str") = "https://download.pytorch.org/torchaudio/tutorial-assets/greatpiratestories_00_various.mp3"

streamer = StreamReader([src](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "builtins.str"))
streamer.add_basic_audio_stream(frames_per_chunk=[segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int"), [sample_rate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")=bundle.[sample_rate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int"))

print(streamer.get_src_stream_info(0))
print(streamer.get_out_stream_info(0)) 
```

```py
SourceAudioStream(media_type='audio', codec='mp3', codec_long_name='MP3 (MPEG audio layer 3)', format='fltp', bit_rate=128000, num_frames=0, bits_per_sample=0, metadata={}, sample_rate=44100.0, num_channels=2)
OutputAudioStream(source_index=0, filter_description='aresample=16000,aformat=sample_fmts=fltp', media_type='audio', format='fltp', sample_rate=16000.0, num_channels=2) 
```

如前所述，Emformer RNN-T 模型期望具有重叠的输入数据；然而，Streamer 在没有重叠的情况下迭代源媒体，因此我们制作了一个辅助结构，从 Streamer 缓存一部分输入数据作为右上下文，然后将其附加到来自 Streamer 的下一个输入数据。

以下图示说明了这一点。

![`download.pytorch.org/torchaudio/tutorial-assets/emformer_rnnt_streamer_context.png`](img/a57362a983bfc8977c146b9cec1fbdc5.png)

```py
class ContextCacher:
  """Cache the end of input data and prepend the next input data with it.

 Args:
 segment_length (int): The size of main segment.
 If the incoming segment is shorter, then the segment is padded.
 context_length (int): The size of the context, cached and appended.
 """

    def __init__(self, [segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int"): int, [context_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int"): int):
        self.[segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") = [segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")
        self.[context_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") = [context_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")
        self.context = [torch.zeros](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.zeros.html#torch.zeros "torch.zeros")([[context_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")])

    def __call__(self, chunk: [torch.Tensor](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")):
        if chunk.size(0) < self.[segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int"):
            chunk = [torch.nn.functional.pad](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.pad.html#torch.nn.functional.pad "torch.nn.functional.pad")(chunk, (0, self.[segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") - chunk.size(0)))
        chunk_with_context = [torch.cat](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cat.html#torch.cat "torch.cat")((self.context, chunk))
        self.context = chunk[-self.[context_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") :]
        return chunk_with_context 
```

## 5\. 运行流推理

最后，我们运行识别。

首先，我们初始化流迭代器、上下文缓存器以及解码器使用的状态和假设，用于在推理调用之间传递解码状态。

```py
cacher = ContextCacher([segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int"), [context_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int"))

[state](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "builtins.list"), [hypothesis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "builtins.list") = None, None 
```

接下来，我们运行推理。

为了更好地显示，我们创建了一个辅助函数，该函数处理源流直到给定次数，并重复调用它。

```py
stream_iterator = streamer.stream()

def _plot(feats, num_iter, unit=25):
    unit_dur = [segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") / [sample_rate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") * unit
    num_plots = num_iter // unit + (1 if num_iter % unit else 0)
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(num_plots, 1)
    t0 = 0
    for i, ax in enumerate(axes):
        feats_ = feats[i * unit : (i + 1) * unit]
        t1 = t0 + [segment_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") / [sample_rate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int") * len(feats_)
        feats_ = [torch.cat](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cat.html#torch.cat "torch.cat")([f[2:-2] for f in feats_])  # remove boundary effect and overlap
        ax.imshow(feats_.T, extent=[t0, t1, 0, 1], aspect="auto", origin="lower")
        ax.tick_params(which="both", left=False, labelleft=False)
        ax.set_xlim(t0, t0 + unit_dur)
        t0 = t1
    fig.suptitle("MelSpectrogram Feature")
    plt.tight_layout()

@torch.inference_mode()
def run_inference(num_iter=100):
    global [state](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "builtins.list"), [hypothesis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "builtins.list")
    chunks = []
    feats = []
    for i, (chunk,) in enumerate(stream_iterator, start=1):
        segment = cacher(chunk[:, 0])
        features, length = feature_extractor(segment)
        hypos, [state](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "builtins.list") = decoder.infer(features, length, 10, [state](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "builtins.list")=[state](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "builtins.list"), [hypothesis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "builtins.list")=[hypothesis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "builtins.list"))
        [hypothesis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "builtins.list") = hypos
        transcript = token_processor(hypos[0][0], lstrip=False)
        print(transcript, end="\r", flush=True)

        chunks.append(chunk)
        feats.append(features)
        if i == num_iter:
            break

    # Plot the features
    _plot(feats, num_iter)
    return IPython.display.Audio([torch.cat](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cat.html#torch.cat "torch.cat")(chunks).T.numpy(), rate=bundle.[sample_rate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "builtins.int")) 
```
